Repository created for practicing git commands and making the best out of Version Control :)

Hi! Welcome.

I am trying to understand the basics of Git and get comfortable with version control. This repository has been created for practicing and learning.

Also, I will soon post the commands I learnt and share them in this file for everyone to access.
